								<h2 class="major">Who Am I?</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/Family pic.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>I was born and raised in the “Land of the Midnight Sun” in the Southeast Alaskan town of Ketchikan. Every summer it was work, fishing and baseball, always in a different order.</p>
								<p>I served an LDS Mission to Bogotá, Colombia and have been trying to improve my Spanish every day since then. I enjoyed meeting new people, visiting new places and experiencing a new culture.</p>
								<p>Together with my beautiful wife, we have a large and wonderful family that adds color and excitement to each and every day.</p>
								<p>At this point, while I’ve never graduated college, I am confident in saying that I’m close to graduating from the school of Hard Knocks.</p>
								<p>I feel we are all in the “service industry” in one way or another, either to family, friends or strangers.</p>
                <p>Throughout my life, confidence in my ability to succeed has created many opportunities to acquire new skills and expand existing ones. I’m not afraid to try my hand at something I’ve never done. It’s amazing how I’m always presented with opportunities to use them for the benefit of others. I admit, humbly, but with confidence, that I’m a man of many abilities.</p>
								<p>I strive to live my life such that my family can put on my tombstone: “Corey was a great husband, father, son, brother and friend.”</p>

                <p>“On my honor I will do my best to do my duty to God and my country and to obey the Scout Law; to help other people at all times; to keep myself physically strong, mentally awake and morally straight.” – Scout Oath</p>
                <p>“A scout is: Trustworthy, Loyal, Helpful, Friendly, Courteous, Kind, Obedient, Cheerful, Thrifty, Brave, Clean and Reverent.” – Scout Law</p>
                <p>“I learned those words as a very young man. Most of you men in this room learned them when you were very young. They have stayed with me through a lifetime, as I know they have with you. For many of us, those words have changed our world, and yet, the Scout Oath has only 40 words in it. Forty words that can make an awfully big difference in the way the boy who becomes a man lives out his life.” – Jimmy Stewart</p>
                <p>As an Eagle Scout of over 30 years I strive to embody all the above in every aspect of my life.</p>
                <p>If you really KNOW and UNDERSTAND these two sayings, then you KNOW what kind of person I am.</p>
                <p>You know I’m the person you need.</p>
